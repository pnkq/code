        <h1>Software</h1>
        I have written some fundamental tools for Vietnamese text processing which were widely used by the community. The toolkit includes a word segmentation tool, a part-of-speech tagger, a dependency parser, a named entity recognizer. These tools are all open source and published under the GNU GPL.
        Here are some links to the tools:

            <li><a href="https://github.com/phuonglh/vn.vitk">vitk</a> (old toolkit, written in Java)</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/phuonglh/ai.vitk.ner">vitk-ner</a> (old toolkit, written in Scala)</li>
        </ul>
        Most of my programs are currently written in the Julia programming language. They will be made open soon.
